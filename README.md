## Goal

Create Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data from a fitness tracker to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.

## Data

Collected by MetaMotion Sensor (https://mbientlab.com/metamotions/) during gym workouts where participants (5 total) were performing various barbell exercises.

## Code
The project uses some classes and functions from the https://github.com/mhoogen/ML4QS/ repository to transform data and train models.
This repository provides all the code associated with the book titled "Machine Learning for the Quantified Self", authored by Mark Hoogendoorn and Burkhardt Funk and published by Springer in 2018.
